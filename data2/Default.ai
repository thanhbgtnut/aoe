//Overview of .ai (artificial intelligence) file creation
//=======================================================
//You may modify this file to create new computer player strategies.  To do
//so, follow the instructions below and save the file as a text file with an
//.ai extension.
//
//.ai files contain the units, buildings and research that will be performed
//by the computer player in the general order listed.  The computer will
//will try to progress through the list and maintain what has been
//built.  For example, when a unit or building in the list is destroyed,
//it will generally be replaced before a new unit or building further down
//on the list will be created.
//
//The sample list below contains one of every item to be trained, built, or 
//researched in Age of Empires.  Storage Pits, Houses, and Granaries (although
//included in the list) can be handled completely by the computer player
//(if the appropriate strategic number is set for the computer player).  In
//other words, these need not be placed in the list at all; the computer player
//will build them when they are needed.
//
//The sequence of items in this list is important.  For example, the Market
//must be built before a Farm, etc.  As long as the game rules are respected
//by maintaining the prerequisite order, items in the list can be resequenced.
//The technology tree foldout is a good reference source for the prerequisites.
//
//Items on the list that cannot be built or researched (for any reason) are 
//eventually skipped (the skipping can be controlled by setting strategic
//numbers in the computer player’s .per file).
//
//If there are already units on the board that are also in the Strategy 
//list, these units will be counted as already created and will not be rebuilt.
//
//
//Notes on .per (personality) files
//================================== 
//The computer player is really controlled by two files:  This .ai file
//and another file called a .per file. The .per file contains strategic numbers
//that the computer player users to control the actual execution of the
//strategy contained in a given .ai file.  The default strategic number system
//should work well for most of the strategies that you write.  If you need
//or want to modify the strategic numbers, see the persnlty.doc 
//file in the Docs folder of your Age of Empires directory.
//
//
//Item descriptions
//=================
//Some of the names contained in this file do not correspond directly with
//the game names.  They are as follows:
//
//Description			Actual 
//----------------		-----------------------------
//Soldier-Chariot2		Chariot Archer 
//Soldier-Chariot1		Chariot
//Composite_Bow		Research Improved bow
//Longbow			Research Composite bow
//Boat-War4			Catapult Trireme
//R73 Legion			Research Phalanx 
//R77 Legion			Research Legion
//Soldier-Catapult1		Stone Thrower
//R54 Heavy_Catapult    Research Catapult
//R36 Massive_Catapult  Research Heavy Catapult
//
//
//Hints & Tips
//============
//Here are some tips for creating your own .ai files.  The sample
//file at the bottom of this document does not necessarily adhere 
//to the principles that follow.  Instead, this list is placed
//in an order that makes the items easy to find so that you may
//create your own list.
//
//1.  Keep the quantity field down to 1 or 2.  Higher quantities will cause
//    the computer player to pause on that item until the quantity is
//    fulfilled.
//
//2.  Do not research or build an item from a building directly after 
//    constructing that building.  Example:  Don’t place Bowman after 
//    Archery Range.  Doing so may cause the computer to pause on 
//    the Bowman until the Archery Range construction is complete.
//    Instead, put another item between the Archery Range and the Bowman.
//
//3.  Do not place two or more items in a row that come from the same
//    building.  Example:  Priest, followed by Polytheism, Mysticism
//    and Astrology.  Instead, stagger items from multiple buildings
//    to ensure that production at one building does not slow
//    progress through the rest of the list.  Good example:
//      Priest
//      Man
//      Polytheism
//      Man
//      Mysticism
//      Market
//      Astrology.
//
//4.  Limit retrains (see below) of early-age infantry and archers.
//    This ensures that when they are killed they will not be retrained.
//    This frees slots (under the population cap) for them to be 
//    replaced by higher-level soldiers.  The same concept applies to 
//    villagers and fishing boats.
//
//5.  Limit the number of units trained to approximately 125.  When
//    the computer reaches its population cap of 125, its advance
//    through the remainder of the list will slow down.  If your list
//    calls for 30 villagers and 30 military units, do the following:
//    -Put 10 villagers, or early-age soldiers on limited retrain. 
//     This will open slots for 10 superior replacements later.
//    -Put the last 2-10 units you want to have trained in the
//     very last line of the file.  This way, if you exceed the
//     population cap, you will do so on the last item and not
//     interrupt the progress of the list.
//
//6.  Start by modifying an .ai file that is already close in content
//    to the file you want to create.  If that list is missing certain
//    items, copy them from the list below and paste them into your
//    .ai file.
//
//7.  In the Stone Age, the computer must be able to quickly locate
//    forage bushes, trees, and/or water.  Failure to do so will 
//    cause the computer not to place a Granary, Storage Pit, and/or 
//    a Dock.  This may prevent your .ai file from reaching
//    the Tool Age, since these buildings are necessary prerequisites
//    for reaching the Tool Age.
//
//8.  Test!  After you have completed your .ai file, put it into a scenario,
//    give the computer unlimited resources, and observe the build
//    process on x2 speed.  Insure that all items are correctly built.
//    Delete items that have limited retrains and ensure that they are
//    replaced with other units.  This technique will greatly accelerate
//    your .ai design and development process.
//
//
//Legend for the prefix to the ID number
//======================================
//Each object in the game has a unique ID number.  In the strategy file, that
//ID number is preceded by a qualifying prefix.  The prefixes are listed below:
//
// B - Building - Will be rebuilt if destroyed.
// A - Building - Will be rebuilt up to to the number of times
//                specified in the “Limited Retrains” column.
// R - Research - Item will be researched if possible.  If not possible,
//                it will be skipped according to the strategic numbers.
// C - Research - Item will be researched if possible.  If not possible,
//                the computer player will progress no further until
//                this critical research is done.  For example, if the computer
//                player does not have enough food to advance to the Tool
//                Age, it will wait to collect enough food and will not skip 
//                the Tool Age).
// U - Unit     - Will always be replaced if killed.
// T - Unit     - Will be trained up to the number of times specified
//                in the “Limited Retrains” column.  Example:  1 indicates
//                that this unit will be created once.  Once killed, this
//                unit will not be created again.
